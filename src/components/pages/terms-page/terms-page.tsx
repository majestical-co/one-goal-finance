              <li>
                <strong>a. Entire Agreement</strong>
                <br /> These Terms and our Privacy Policy represent the entire and exclusive agreement between you and One Goal, L.L.C. regarding your use of the Site and Services,
                superseding and replacing all previous agreements. You may also be subject to additional terms and conditions or separate agreements regarding specific Services we
                provide, partner or affiliate services, use of Third-Party Resources, or any purchases you may make through the Site. <br />
                In the event that these Terms are translated into other languages and there is a discrepancy between the two language versions, the English language version will
                prevail in all cases to the extent that such discrepancy is the result of an error in translation.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>b. Waiver and Severability</strong>
                <br /> Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not operate as a waiver of such right or provision.

                If any provision of these Terms or the application thereof is held to be invalid or unenforceable for any reason and to any extent, that provision will be
                considered removed from these Terms; however, the remaining provisions will continue to be valid and enforceable according to the intentions of the Parties and to
                the maximum extent permitted by law. If it is held that any provision of these Terms is invalid or unenforceable, but that by limiting such provision it would
                become valid and enforceable, then such provision will be deemed to be written, construed, and enforced as so limited.

                these Terms and our rights and obligations hereunder without notice to you, and these Terms will continue to be binding on assignees.
