            <li>
              <strong>Cookies.</strong>A "cookie" is a small piece of data that is stored on a visitor's hard drive in order to store information about visitor preferences and
              activities on the Site. We use this information to optimize the experiences of our visitors. For instance, a cookie can help us identify you when you return to the

              such cookies. However, any use of cookies will not relate to any personally identifiable information about you. You may also choose to refuse to accept cookies by
              configuring the appropriate setting on your browser. However, doing so may prevent you from being able to access parts of the Site or Services and may prevent the

              from your browser. You may be able to disable web beacons in our email communications by turning off "images" in your email client settings. However, doing so may
              prevent you from being able to properly enjoy our Services as they are designed to be used.
            </li>

              <strong>Flash Cookies.</strong> A "flash cookie" is a local shared object (a text file) sent from a web server to a client when a browser requests content supported
              by the Adobe Flash browser plug-in. Your preferences for flash cookies are not managed in the same way as browser cookies. Instead, you may change your preferences
              for flash cookies by changing your settings on

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>DoubleClick DART Cookies.</strong> A "DoubleClick DART cookie" is a cookie that, according to Google, Inc., "is used by Google in the ads served on publisher
              websites displaying AdSense for content ads. When users visit an AdSense publisher's website and either view or click on an ad, a cookie may be dropped on that end
              user's browser. The data gathered from these cookies will be used to help AdSense publishers better serve and manage the ads on their site(s) and across the web." You
              may opt out of using the DART cookie by visiting the Google ad and content network <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads">privacy policy.</a>
