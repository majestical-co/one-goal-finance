    title: 'Budgeting Alternatives to YNAB: Why One Goal is the Best Solution',
    description: '',
    body: '<p>You’ve been a YNABer for years, but now that they’ve increased their annual service fees you’re looking at budgeting alternatives for YNAB (You Need A Budget). The free budgeting tools that are out there don’t offer the features you need to stay current on a modern budget, but what other options are there? Two words: One Goal.</p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="og-video-wrapper"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZpYQ_CdPLtA?rel=0" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><h2>Lower Fees, More Fun</h2>\n<p>YNAB recently announced an <a href="https://www.youneedabudget.com/pricing/" target="_blank">increase in their costs</a>, and now an annual subscription will set you back $98. Paying monthly costs even more, at $14.99/month. If these costs seem a bit much to you, you’re not alone. One Goal provides superior budgeting tools at a more affordable rate. For only $8/month or $80/year, you get priority support from the One Goal team, transactions automatically imported from your bank, simple and easy-to-use drag-and-drop categorizing, and so much more. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Not only will you pay less for financial freedom, but you can also have fun doing it! One Goal celebrates 🎉  when you’ve categorized all of your transactions, explodes 💥 budgets when you’ve overspent, and has helpful hints to keep you on track. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Budget Weekly, Think Yearly</h2>\n<p>YNAB users often struggle to budget monthly when their paychecks come in biweekly. This becomes a problem when you set your grocery budget at $800 for the month, yet if you spent all $800 of it in the first week of the month then you might not have enough to pay your housing payment or other bills when they come due.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One Goal offers the best budgeting alternatives to YNAB because it solves this problem by creating weekly budgets with the entire year in mind. It doesn’t matter if you get paid every week or three times a year, One Goal’s budgeting tools will break down all of the budgets into weekly amounts so you never have to worry about not having enough to meet your financial obligations.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>And the best part? One Goal automatically funds your budgets every week so you don’t have to decide where your money is going every single time you get paid. Weekly budgeting helps you break the paycheck-to-paycheck cycle and think about the bigger picture. </p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>What Is One Goal?</h2>\n<p>One Goal is an innovative budgeting tool that helps you create and follow a spending plan using zero balance budgeting. It differs from YNAB in a few key ways. One of those differences is One Goal allows you to set one financial goal and work toward it by applying any remaining balances from your weekly spending toward your financial goal. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Let’s say you decide your one goal is to pay off your mortgage. You budget for your monthly mortgage payment and all of your other expenses. Then your utility bill comes in and it’s $50 less this month than you expected. You now have the option to take that $50 and apply it toward an extra payment on your mortgage. Over time, even pennies left in budget categories can make a difference when they’re all applied toward helping you reach your one goal. Whether your mission is to travel the world, pay off debt, or retire early, One Goal is here to help you fast-track those objectives. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>TL;DR; 6 reasons you should switch to One Goal</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>One Goal follows the same zero-sum principles of YNAB</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>One Goal is fun! It\'s not just a glorified spreadsheet</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>One Goal makes it sooo much easier to track your spending. Simply drag and drop transactions to categorize your spending</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>One Goal automatically funds your budgets weekly, so you can <b>truly</b> stop living paycheck to paycheck</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>One Goal works on all of your devices</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>One Goal costs less than YNAB!</p>\n</li>\n</ol><p></p>\n<p></p>\n<div class="og-video-wrapper"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mA0V_No0Bjs?rel=0" frameborder="0" webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen allowfullscreen></iframe></div><h2>Try One Goal for free today!</h2>\n<p>At One Goal, we know that your budget is an important tool in helping you live the lifestyle you want.

    title: 'How to Create a Spending Plan (Budget)',
    description: "Not sure how to start a budget? Here's a few tips to get you started on the right track!",
    body: "<p>The key to being financially successful begins with a good spending plan. A good spending plan can allow you to turn your lifelong goals into a reality. Remember that trip to Europe that you always wanted to take? Or that beautiful house you have had your eye on? With a spending plan, you can take control of your money and find ways to start saving for your dreams. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Follow the steps below to create your dream-achieving spending plan:</p>\n<p></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><b>Add Up All Household Income</b>; First things first, you need a source of income. If you have multiple streams of income, great! The more the merrier! </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><b>Subtract All Monthly Bills</b>; It is best to go through your bank transactions and find which ones are recurring and add them to the list. Sometimes you will find bills that you didn’t realize you were paying for. Another reason why a budget is so useful! </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><b>Create a Savings Plan</b>; Pay yourself first! Before allocating spending money for things like groceries, entertainment, or allowances, put money aside for savings. Your goals should be top priority! You may find that you will want to cut out some bills and shorten your spending so that you can save faster. </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><b>Categorize All Spending</b>; Once you pay yourself through savings, take the remaining amount (Income - Bills - Savings = Spending) and create spending categories. The more detailed you are in these categories, the more knowledge you have of where your money goes, and the more power you will have over your money. </p>\n</li>\n</ol><p></p>\n<h2>Important things to remember! </h2>\n<p>All money should be put into a category. When you subtract bills, savings, and spending from your income, it should come out to zero. If you have money remaining, put it towards your savings plan! Don’t be afraid to adjust your spending plan to allow for more saving! It might be hard at first to let go of those weekly ice cream outings, but if you are saving for your dream house, then Cold Stone can wait.  </p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Try Budgeting Weekly!</h2>\n<p>Most savings plans budget expenses on a monthly basis. However, how often do you find yourself at the grocery store at the end of the month trying to remember how much was left in your shopping budget? This is where budgeting on a weekly basis can prove to be a powerful tool. By making your spending plan weekly, it is easier to track how much you actually have left! This in turn will help you avoid being so overwhelmed by your spending plan that you want to throw it out the window. <b>You can do anything for one week,<i> including sticking to a budget. </i></b></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Use an App </h2>\n<p>Next, you should find a good budgeting app! A good app will help you easily track your spending plan and will be more accessible on your phone. Obviously we're biased, so we recommend using One Goal. One Goal is one of the only budgeting platforms that helps you plan your whole year, and budget on a weekly basis. It also has a drag and drop feature for transactions, which makes categorizing spending a breeze.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Lastly, it is important to remember that life is always changing. You should review your plan often, but it doesn’t have to rule your life. A good savings plan is a powerful tool. Let it help you create the future you always wanted.</p>",

    description: 'Last, but not least, learn how to best manage your transactions so that you can stay on top of your spending plan.',
    body: '<p>Now that we have linked our accounts, created a spending plan, and funded our budgets, it’s time to start categorizing transactions. If you linked your bank account, your transactions will automatically start showing up at the bottom of the screen. If you manually added your account, you will need to manually add transactions.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>You can manually add transactions by going to the “All Transactions” tab on the left side of the screen. You can then click on the plus button in the top right corner and a window will pop up. Here you can name the transaction, put a date for when it occurred, the amount, and which budget you would like to put it in. You can also change the transaction from a withdrawal to deposit if the money is coming into your account. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>As the recent transactions start to come into your account (or if you have manually added some), you will see them start to appear in the bottom blue bar. This is where all uncategorized transactions show up. One Goal has a drag and drop feature that makes categorizing your transactions a breeze. This works for the phone app as well as the windows version. Once you select a transaction at the bottom you can drag it into any category you wish. You can also go into the individual transaction and select the category from there if that is easier for you. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When you drop a transaction into your income or bills budgets, it will ask you when the next paycheck comes or when the next bill is due. This will help you stay on track with your bills and help ensure that you don’t miss a paycheck. The bills category also shows whether or not you are on track for your next bill or if you need to add more money. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Sometimes the transactions will have long numbers and names associated with them which makes it hard to know where it should go. If you select the transaction, it will show an even longer name which usually contains some clue as to where it came from. If you are still unsure of a transaction, it might be a good idea to contact your bank to ensure that it was not a fraudulent purchase. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Another great feature of One Goal is the ability to split transactions. When you select a transaction, there is a plus button that says “Split Transaction”. When you click the plus button, you will be able to pick a second budget of where you want the money to come from. You can add as many budgets as you would like. You can then type in how much money it will take from each budget or you can change the option to split by percentage. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you overspend in a budget, One Goal will pop up with a window telling you that you broke your budget. You can choose to fix it later if you would like or fix it now. When you click on fix, it will tell you how much money you need to get your budget back to zero and where you want to pull that money from. You can pull the money from anywhere including your income, however, we strongly suggest that you resolve overspending within your spending categories. When you take from other spending budgets, you ensure that your savings goals and bills are on track, and that your income is saved specifically for filling your weekly budgets.</p>\n<p>In the instance that you would like to ignore a transaction, you can select it and then under budgets there will be an ignore option. We highly suggest not ignoring any transactions, especially not that cheeseburger from last week that you don’t want your significant other to see. However, if you were double charged for something and then refunded, you might want to ignore the second purchase and refund. When you ignore a transaction, you want to make sure it is only for something that would not affect your budgets in any way. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you have ignored important transactions, you will find a warning on your accounts page saying “There’s more Money in your budgets than in your accounts”. This warning will also show up on the Overview page. You want to make sure to select that warning and a window will pop up showing you what your accounts need. Go ahead and select the “Balance Budgets With Accounts” button. This doesn’t change how much money you have in your account, however, it will change the amount of income you have in your budgets so that everything is balanced. You may get the opposite warning where there’s more money in your accounts than your budgets. Follow the same steps as above and your accounts will be automatically balanced. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Categorizing transactions is not a difficult thing to do, however it is one of the most important things you can do to stay on track with your savings goals. By categorizing transactions, you will find just how much money you are actually spending and which budgets may need help. One Goal makes it easy to keep up with categorizing transactions and will help you be consistent with your budget so that you can reach your financial dreams.

    title: 'Funding Your Budgets',
    description: 'Here is a simple way to fund your first budgets in One Goal.',
    body: '<p>Once you have created your spending plan, you will find that your budgets are empty. While you can manually go through each page and add money, the easiest way is with the automatic tool found on the overview page. You will now see that the green banner at the top of the overview page says “Let’s fund your budgets”. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>After you have selected the green banner, a small window will pop up that says “Balance Budgets with Accounts”. This window shows your income as well as your savings, bills, and spending budgets. Starting with savings, you can allocate however much money that is currently in your account to each of these budgets. The income at the top will automatically calculate how much is left for other budgets. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Next you will add money to your bills. The bills category is pretty unique in the fact that it will take the day your payment is due and then tell you how much money you need in order to reach that goal on time. The little black box with the warning sign in it shows the amount needed. If you select the black box, the needed amount will automatically fill that budget from your income. Go ahead and do this for all of your bills. You will now see that they are all on track.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Now that your savings and bills are taken care of, you will need to allocate money to each of your spending budgets. Remember that your budget will fill this coming Sunday (or whatever day you set it to be) with that amount you set when you created your spending plan. If the budgets are supposed to fill in a couple of days, you might not need as much in each category. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Once you have added money to all three categories, you will click the button “Balance Budgets With Accounts”. This will finalize any changes you made within the small window. If you click through each of your budgets, you will see that they have now been filled. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you go back to the income page you will see that the income saved will be less than what is actually in your account. This is because you have already allocated some of those funds to your budgets. One Goal is a very powerful tool because it can help you see how much money you actually have available after all your needs are taken care of. You are less likely to spend as much money when you don’t see a lump sum in your account and think you have more than you actually do. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>You have now linked your accounts, created a spending plan, and filled your budgets. You now have One Goal completely up and running. As you continue to use the app, your transactions will start coming in and you will be on your way to reaching those financial goals. If you have any questions or feedback, don’t hesitate to let us know! </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><ion-button href="/getting-started/categorizing-transactions">Next Up: Categorizing Transactions</ion-button></p>',

    description: 'Follow this simple guide to create your first spending plan within One Goal.',
    body: '<p>The easiest way to create your first spending plan is to go to the overview page and click on the green “Create Budgets” banner at the top. This will launch you into a quick setup of all of your different budgets. Once you have done this, you will be greeted with the welcome page, go ahead and press “Lets Do it”. You will now have the ability to select one of three options: </p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>Get out of debt</b>: This option is for individuals who are looking to pay off a loan, like a mortgage, car, or student loans. This option will automatically turn one of your bill budgets into your One Goal, so that all extra money will go towards paying off that bill faster. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>Save Money</b>: If you are looking to save money towards a home, buying a car, family vacation, or any other savings you might want to select this option. By doing so, you will create a savings budget as your One Goal. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>Stop living paycheck to paycheck</b>: This option may be for you if you are finding it hard not to spend everything you earn before the next month. Selecting this option will make your income category your One Goal. Overtime, your income will grow steadily and you will see areas you can improve on a week to week basis. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>At the end of the day, it doesn’t really matter which option you pick. You will still be creating budgets within bills, spending, and savings categories. Only how you create your One Goal will change.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>After selecting the option that best fits you, you will create your first One Goal. This is your big savings goal that all extra money will go to, so that you can reach it faster. Depending on which path you chose, your One Goal could be a bill budget, a savings budget, or your income budget. You will have the ability to change this whenever and however you like later if you need.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>After creating your first One Goal, you will be asked what your expected income is. Click on the plus icon, give it a name, choose the amount, frequency, and next pay day. If you have multiple streams of income, you can also add them here. If you have income that is not a set amount, or on a specific day, you can set it to $0.00 with no repeat day, however, it will not count towards your weekly income.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Once you have added your expected income, you will then create your budgets. You will first add your bills. One Goal will automatically recommend different categories that are common to the average person. You can select as many as you need and will have the option to add more bills on the next page. From here you can add a due date for each bill and the amount needed for that certain bill. </p>\n<p>Next you will create your savings budgets. Similar to how the bills were created, you will be presented with common categories for you to choose from. You will also have the ability to add more savings budgets on the following page. Last, you will create spending categories, which follows a similar setup like the previous two.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>With each of the budgets you will create, you have the option to name the budget and then how much money you want to be set aside towards that budget. The neat thing about One Goal is that you have the flexibility to pick a certain amount and whether you want it every week, every two weeks, every month, etc., and it will automatically calculate how much that budget needs weekly. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Each budget will also have the option to “Overflow to One Goal”, so if you know you won’t need more than the set amount, it would be a good idea to check this box so that any extra money will go towards your One Goal. Not only does this help you to reach our goals faster, but allows you to use your excess money in a smarter way.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Once you have created as many budgets as you need, you will select the button View My Cash Flow. This will take you back to the overview page and as you can see, the information has now been updated. You can see how much of your weekly income is going towards savings, bills, and spending. You can also see how much extra money you have from income that isn’t going towards one of the three budget categories. Ideally, all of your extra income should be going towards your One Goal so that number would be zero. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>You have now set up your first spending plan within One Goal! Now that the hard part is over, you are on your way to creating the best financial life you can. If you have any questions or feedback, don’t hesitate to let us know! </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><ion-button href="/getting-started/funding-your-budgets">Next up: Funding Your Budgets</ion-button></p>',

    title: 'How to Link Accounts',
    description: 'Learn how to link your bank accounts to One Goal with this easy guide.',
    body: '<p></p>\n<p>The first step to getting started with One Goal is to link your accounts. There are two main ways to add your accounts. The first method is by linking your bank account and the second is adding your account manually.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>Link Account</b></p>\n<p>To link your bank account to One Goal you will go to the accounts tab on the side and select the little plus button in the top right corner. Then select the first option: Link Account. One Goal uses Plaid to link to your bank. This is a secure and private connection that protects your personal financial data and does not allow your credentials to be shared with One Goal. Plaid is a safe method and is used by many popular apps like Venmo.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Once you click continue, you will be shown a list of common financial institutions. You can choose your bank from this list or search by your bank’s name. After finding your bank, you will be asked to input your credentials. These credentials are the ones used to login to your bank’s app or website (not your One Goal username and password). Once you have input the requested information, your account will now be linked. We highly recommend this process as it makes tracking your finances so much easier. If, however, you wish not to link your actual account, you can add it manually. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>Add Account Manually</b></p>\n<p>This option is not recommended unless you don’t want to link your bank account, since you will have to manually input all transactions as well. If this is something you prefer however, feel free to follow these steps. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>To add an account manually you will click the accounts tab on the side of the page. You will then click on the plus button on the top right corner and then click “ Add Account Manually”. A window will pop up where you can name the account and then select the type. A checking/cash account will work differently than a credit account, so make sure you pick the correct type. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>You can then choose a color and put in the current total of the account. For a checking/cash account, make sure that the current balance and available balance have the same amount. You will then toggle “Include in Total Available” so that the account will be counted towards your budgets. Now click save and you will see your account appear on the accounts page. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When adding a credit account, make sure the type says credit. You will then put in the limit of the card or account and how much you have currently spent. The available balance will update once you save the account. Make sure you toggle “Include in Total Available” so that it will be counted towards your budgets. Once you click save, you will see the credit account appear against your checking account. This will give you a good idea of how much money you actually have available in your accounts. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Make sure to add all of your accounts even if they are at different financial institutions so that you have a good idea of where all of your money is at. Now that you have linked all of your accounts, you are ready to make a spending plan. If you have any questions or feedback, don’t hesitate to let us know! </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><ion-button href="/getting-started/creating-your-spending-plan">Next up: Creating Your Spending Plan</ion-button></p>',

    title: '3 Tips for Success With Using One Goal',
    description: 'One Goal is a great tool to help you become financially successful. To get the most out of One Goal, follow these three tips!',
    body: "<p>Your financial freedom all depends on you. That might sound daunting, but don't let it stress you out! One Goal is here to help! From its easy drag and drop transactions, clean and clear user interface, and a simple— yet powerful— overview, you will take control of your money and be on your way to financial freedom. To get the most success out of One Goal, we suggest following these three tips:</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. Check Your Budgets Daily</h2>\n<p>This is the single most important financial advice anyone could receive. Controlling your money starts with the ability to check where it is going on a day to day basis! One Goal helps you see where your accounts are, what bills are coming up, which budgets need help, or if you have any extra money in your dining budget for some Chick-Fil-A. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>When checking your budgets daily, you should also be categorizing all of your transactions to get a more accurate picture of your finances. If you haven’t checked your One Goal for a little while, the transactions can build up from a molehill into a mountain. When you are consistent, you are less likely to ditch your budget at the first sign of setback. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Make Sure All Transactions Are Categorized</h2>\n<p>Every transaction should be put into some sort of category. If you have a catch-all budget (a budget where all random transactions go), it is hard to calculate how much you actually need for the week or month. Try to make your budgets as specific and detailed as possible so that you know exactly where your money is going. This will also help you see if any of your budgets have extra money that can go towards your One Goal. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Use Money From Other Budgets Before Income</h2>\n<p>When you break a budget in One Goal, you'll have the option to move money from another budget in order to balance out the broken budget. We highly suggest moving money from another spending budget, rather than pulling from your income. You've already set a plan for how you'll be spending your income, so if you pull from income it could mess up your plan.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you need to put more money into a broken budget, do yourself a favor and take it from a budget that has extra money in it for the week. By doing this, you can fix your budgets and still keep your income where it needs to be to stay on track.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One Goal is an amazing resource that can help you live your life without financial worry. Take advantage of it! These three tips are only suggestions, but if followed, they will help ensure your success with using One Goal.</p>",

    body: "<p>We get it, budgeting weekly is probably the biggest change you'l notice when using One Goal... but it'll be worth it, here's our pitch on why:</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Why Does One Goal Budget Weekly?</h2>\n<p>The first thing you may notice when you start using One Goal is that your spending plans are allocated on a weekly basis. This may be completely new to you if you are used to calculating your budget per month. However, you shouldn’t let that scare you away. Having a weekly budget will change your world for the better and get you to financial success faster than you can imagine. </p>\n<p>Here are three reasons why One Goal uses a weekly basis to budget:</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>1. You Already Have a Weekly Spending Routine </h2>\n<p>Whether you know it or not, you already spend money on a weekly basis. Maybe you go to the grocery store on Monday, get gas on Wednesday, and go out to eat on the weekend. Or maybe your life gets crazy and you don’t have specific days that you do any of those things, yet you find yourself doing them at least once a week. If you have a certain amount of money for each of those weekly activities, you will find it easier to remember how much you can actually spend. This in turn helps you to keep your budget and stay on track to reaching your savings goals. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>2. Track Accounts With More Frequency </h2>\n<p>How often do you get to the end of the month and think, “When did my account get so low”?! When you budget on a weekly basis, you will be checking your spending more frequently and be able to better track where your money is going. You will also find it easier to manage transactions this way, instead of spending hours doing it at the end of the month. A weekly budget can help eliminate stress that comes from a monthly one, and by doing so, will help you develop the habits to actually keep it. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>3. Better Financial Habits Can Be Created Weekly</h2>\n<p>When you have good financial habits, you can take control of your money, stay out of debt, and be on a path to reaching larger goals. By tracking your budget weekly, you can begin to develop these good habits. Top athletes did not get where they are by working out once a month. By breaking down where you want to go into bite size pieces, you will be able to adjust faster, be more consistent, and actually reach the dreams you have always wanted. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One Goal is weekly to match your already weekly routines, help you stay on top of your money, and create better financial habits. Budgeting on a weekly basis may be a new concept, but we promise the return will be worth the change! A weekly budget will give you 52 chances to improve your spending, and each time get you closer and closer to achieving your goals. </p>",

    title: 'How can I break the paycheck-to-paycheck cycle?',
    description: '',
    body: '<h2>Step 1: Make sure we are spending less than we are making. </h2>\n<p>In One Goal, tap the "Plan" button in the top right, the weekly "Cash Flow" will appear just below the top bar. When we\'re breaking the paycheck cycle we actually want that amount to be POSITIVE! For example, if it says "Extra Income to budget ... $15" that means that if we followed our plan every week, we\'d have $15 extra in our Income reserve each week. The more positive cash flow we have the faster we\'ll break the cycle. In order to do this, we\'ll need to cut back on some unnecessary expenses, which leads us to step 2.<br></p>\n<h2>Step 2: Cut back on unnecessary expenses.</h2>\n<p>This could be as simple as not going out to lunch every day, perhaps cancelling Netflix for the next few months (just watch funny youtube videos together instead 😁), or planning some cheaper dates for date night. In One Goal we can use the "Overview" page to view where our money is going. Tap overview (inside the main menu), then tap "Plan".  Here is a list of all the budget categories, and what percentage of our income goes toward these categories. Tap on a category (like Spending), it will show all the budgets of that category below it, with their percentages as well. If one budget looks like it\'s taking up a high percentage, we can quickly edit our plan right there to even things out.<br></p>\n<h2>Step 3. Try to set aside enough for 1 week of income saved.</h2>\n<p>In order to break the paycheck-to-paycheck cycle, we need to save money for the future. Rather than spending it right as we get it, we put it into the "Income" reservoir. If we have at least 1 week saved in our Income, then our budgets will fill automatically, and that\'s the goal! We want our budgets filling automatically so that we don\'t have to worry about it! Once our budgets are filling automatically, we want them to keep filling automatically, we can help increase our income savings by setting our One Goal to "Income"<br></p>\n<h2>Step 4: Set the One Goal to "Income."</h2>\n<p>This is where One Goal gets its name. We can choose a goal that we agree on, and then every week, if we spend less than expected in our budgets, the extra money is automatically moved to our One Goal! To have the full effect, go through each budget, and set a budget maximum. To get there: tap plan, then tap on a budget (this is the edit budget view), scroll to the bottom where it says "Overflow to One Goal". Toggle that on, and set the budget maximum. <br>Each week as our budgets are filled, if a budget is filled over the maximum, the extra money is sent to our one goal (which should be "Income"). That way any money we don\'t spend this week can be saved for a future week to help us break that living paycheck-to-paycheck cycle.<br></p>\n<h2>Step 5: Trust the budget, and stick to it! </h2>\n<p>As we spend less than we make, we\'ll slowly build up our income reserve. Once we have a few weeks of income saved, we\'ll be able to finally breathe easy without stressing about when the next paycheck will clear! If unexpected expenses come up (and they always do), simply make a new budget and pull money from other categories to balance it out. If we overspend, just move money from another budget to balance it out.</p>\n<p>That\'s it! Please share your struggles/successes as you break that paycheck-to-paycheck cycle! We would love to hear what works for you, so we can share your story with others!</p>',

    title: 'How to Manage Bank Account Transfers',
    description: null,
    body: "<p>If you are tracking multiple accounts in One Goal, and you transfer money between these accounts, you'll notice you'll get two transactions! A negative transaction from one account and a positive transaction from the other. So, how should these be handled in One Goal?</p>\n<p>Let’s a take a look at this example, let’s say that you used your credit card and spent $10 on a carwash and $10 on a burrito. Using One Goal, you budget your car wash transaction into your “Auto Maintenance” budget and your burrito into your “Lunch” budget; nice work! At the end of the month, you pay off your credit card balance which results in a $20 credit transfer from your bank. To prevent budgeting twice for the same transactions, we suggest handling transfers in one of two ways:</p>\n<p><b>Option 1: “Ignore transaction”</b><br>Once the credit transfer appears in your One Goal transaction list, you can simply:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Tap the transaction.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Scroll to the bottom and tap “Ignore Transaction”</p>\n</li>\n</ul><p><b>Option 2: Create a separate bill that will only be used for repeated payments from your bank account to your credit card</b></p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Assign the bill's budget amount each month to be $0.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When a credit transfer is made, two transactions will appear in One Goal. A negative transaction from your bank account, and a positive transaction into your credit card. (ie. -$20 and +$20)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Place both transactions in your Credit Transfer Bill budget totaling $0.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>The bonus of this approach is that you're reminded when that credit card bill is due.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>",

    body: '<p>If you were to focus all your financial efforts on saving for one thing, what would that be? </p>\n<p>Prioritizing where you put your savings is one of the most important financial planning decisions you can make. Like with any other big challenge, saving up for a big ticket item is doable: You just have to take it one step at a time.</p>\n<h2>So, what’s your main goal? </h2>\n<p>Do you dream of paying off your student loans, paying off your mortgage early, buying a new car, or taking the vacation of a lifetime? Do you struggle with finding spare cash to help you save for that goal?</p>\n<p>When you know exactly what’s coming in and out of your bank account, you will find extra cash to help you accomplish your goal! It’s important to have a specific goal that both you and your spouse agree on, that way you can keep focused and diligent toward your savings goal.</p>\n<h2>How can One Goal help?</h2>\n<p>The One Goal app helps you hyper-focus on a specific saving goal. With weekly budgeting, you will find spare dollars and change to help you reach your One Goal faster. Let\'s get started!</p>\n<h2>How to contribute to your One goal:</h2>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Edit one of your budgets by tapping "Plan" then tapping on your budget</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Scroll to the bottom and toggle on "Overflow to One Goal"</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Enter in your budget maximum</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When your budgets fill each week, if your budget reaches the maximum anything extra will get sent to your One Goal!</p>\n</li>\n</ol><p><b>Planning.</b><br>How much will you need? To get started, figure out how much money it will take to make your goal happen. Some big purchases might be fairly easy to estimate; for instance, if you’re interested in buying a specific model of a car, you can do some research to figure out how much others have paid for that vehicle. You can also find information about the cost to maintain the car, the cost of gas, and the general cost of insurance to come up with an overall total you\'ll need to save each month. </p>\n<p>Other purchases might be more complicated. Perhaps you are planning a trip to the Bahamas. Costs will depend on length of stay, transportation, and choosing to indulge in local treats. In these cases, performing as much research as possible and setting realistic budgets (over-estimating never hurts) will help you be financially ready for a fabulous vacation. </p>\n<p><b>Budgeting. <br></b>Once you have all the details of your goal figured out, it’s time to find ways to help you save for it even faster. One Goal takes the excess budget from your envelopes and automatically puts it into your “One Goal” budget. With weekly budgeting and automatic overflow budgeting, you’ll be more likely to stick to your goal instead of relying on willpower and big lifestyle changes to make it happen. Each week, you will be closer to reaching your goal. </p>\n<p><b>How to create your first One Goal:</b></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Tap the “Savings” button at the bottom of the app</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tap the “Plan” button at the top right</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Tap the “+” button </p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Create a new budget</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Go to your Team Settings page, then tap on "One Goal" and select the new budget you created.</p>\n</li>\n</ol><p>That\'s it! You\'ll be saving faster than ever, knocking out those financial goals one by one!</p>',

    title: 'How Is One Goal Different From Other Budgeting Apps?',
    description: 'Wonder what exactly sets One Goal apart from other budgeting apps out there? Here are a couple of reasons why!',
    body: "<p>When it comes to finding the perfect budgeting app, we know you have lots of options. However, none of those apps can help you quite like One Goal. With simple weekly budgeting, easy transaction management, and thorough account overviews, One Goal will help you achieve all of your financial goals. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Here are just a few examples of how One Goal differs from all other budgeting apps:</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>Hyper Focused Saving</b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>A budget is all about finding ways to save, and an app should support you in doing just that. One Goal encourages you to pick a specific savings goal and will do all it can to help you reach it. Hence the name! Whether it's saving up for a home, a new car, a dream vacation, with One Goal you will find it easier to achieve all of this and more. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One Goal shows you how much money you need for spending, bills, and how much you have left over to put towards your “One Goal”. You also have the option to set a max limit on your budgets. Any excess from those budgets will automatically go towards your “One Goal”. Because the app uses weekly budgeting, you will find that your One Goal savings increases faster than it would with any other app. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>Drag and Drop Transactions</b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Have you ever felt overwhelmed by how many transactions you have to categorize? With some apps it can take you awhile since you have to go into each one and manually set where it needs to go. With One Goal you can actually drag and drop transactions! All of the uncategorized transactions sit in a bar at the bottom of the screen, so you can easily hold down the transaction and just drop it on the budget that it goes into. This makes categorizing your transactions a breeze!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>Weekly Budgeting </b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One of the great things about One Goal is that it will budget your expenses on a weekly basis. How often do you get to the end of the month and think, “Where did all of my shopping money go?”. Most apps out there use a monthly system to budget your expenses. Monthly budgeting can be hard to track and you will oftentimes end up forgetting about the budget entirely. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>One Goal uses the envelope system to track your budgets. Each week you will see your “envelopes” or bills, savings, and spending categories automatically fill with how much money you set. When you are able to check how much money you have left in a certain category for the week, you will be less likely to blow the budget. Weeks are so much easier to manage and you will find yourself more on track to reaching your savings goals than you would using a monthly budget. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p><b>Savings Projections</b></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>It can be hard to know how much money you will need for certain goals or how long it will take you to reach them. One Goal has an amazing tool that will help you get the most out of your savings plans! The app will tell you-- based on your budget-- how much you will save each year if you stick to your plan. The overview tab will also show a month to month projection of your savings account for the coming year. This is extremely helpful when planning your future goals. You can adjust your budget if you need to save more or less, and the app will reflect those changes. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Overall, you won’t find another app out there that has all of the features One Goal provides. With amazing ways to help you save, fast drag and drop transactions, and easy to follow weekly budgets, you will find yourself reaching more than you thought possible. Let One Goal be the app you need to find your personal financial success, and the path to achieving your dreams. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>\n<p></p>",
